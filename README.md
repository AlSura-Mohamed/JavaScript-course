## Purpose
These projects represent my first steps into software and web development. They serve as both learning tools and portfolio pieces as I continue to grow my skills and explore more advanced technologies.

## Future Plans
I plan to expand these projects, refine the designs, and eventually integrate frameworks like React or Vue as I progress in my development journey.
